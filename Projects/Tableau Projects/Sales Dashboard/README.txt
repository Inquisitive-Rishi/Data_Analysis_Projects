Dataset Source: https://codebasics.io/resources/sales-insights-data-analysis-project

Source file is sql.

Basic Data Analysis was done on sql to detect some nuances such as negative/null/duplicate values

The data was then imported to Tableau via MySQL database

This project involves the usual ETL procedure of extraction, cleaning and loading of data.

The summary of the project is in the interactive dashboard which also includes maps that shows sales by area.

There were some nuances that caused errors in 'City conversion' in maps that was corrected.

Ok..enough said, here's the project.
