This is my first 'tiny' ML project that predicts India's per_capita_income for the year 2024

Project done in Jupyter Notebook
and the prediction done by Sklearn module that was first imported

Raw data was prepared in Excel with two columns 'Year','pci_($)' 
from year 2010-2020.

This raw data is used as a 'train' data.

At first, scatterplot is created just to visualise the distribution of data.

Then using linear_module from sklearn, year 2024 PCI was predicted.

Then at last, A small linear equation is visualized using trend line.
